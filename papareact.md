## Homework : Let's Build a TODO App with React
Well done for making it to the end of the REACT BASICS module! 

Remember: We will always improve and add to the module so stay tuned in the slack / discord channels for future updates!

 

## The CRUD Homework Assignment!

Your client requires a TODO list application, they have submitted a list of requirements. The application must have the following features:

The ability to type into an input field and hit the ENTER key to add a TODO to a list of TODO's ✅
The ability to delete a todo from the todo list ✅
The ability to update a todo from the todo list ✅
Each TODO must automatically be capitalised when added to the list of TODO's ✅
There should be a button on each TODO to indicate completion of a TODO, the text should turn green and have a strikethrough once completed ✅
The TODO app should be styled appropriately (you could use  !) 
At the top of the page, the client wants an inspirational quote which is different each time the user refreshes the page. The quote should be fetched from the following API: https://type.fit/api/quotes ✅
CHALLENGE: Persist the TODO's so that when the user refreshes the page, the list of TODO's is preserved! ✅
CHALLENGE 2: Add animations to the TODO list using this library!❌ --> how do you implement this functionality ? 
The client requests that the code is submitted to Github for review, once you have done this, fill this form to send the assignment to the client! ✅
